# My-Mapty-App
An application to map your workouts 

This application helps you plan your daily workout by pinpointing places you would like to workout on the map.

It also calculates the cadence for running and elevation gain for cycling based on the distance and duration specified.

This application uses geolocation api to get your location and displays it nicely to you on beautiful map tiles gotten from the leaflet library.

You can map different positions on the map and have it saved even upon page reload
